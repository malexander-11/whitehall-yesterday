# Project Intent  
## Why This Exists

---

## 1. Core Motivation

This project exists for three reasons:

1. To build something useful and valuable.
2. To practice modern AI-assisted development workflows.
3. To understand the technical underpinnings of data-driven products.

It is both a learning vehicle and a disciplined build.

---

## 2. Learning Objectives

This project is intentionally structured to develop skills in:

- Backend-first system design
- API contract definition
- Data modelling and canonical schema design
- Idempotent ingestion patterns
- Operational observability
- Deployment discipline
- Version-controlled decision-making

AI tools (e.g., Claude Code and others) are used as:
- Architectural reviewers
- Failure simulators
- Schema critics
- Bounded code generators

---

## 3. Engineering Philosophy

The project follows these principles:

- Define scope before writing code.
- Lock decisions before implementing.
- Separate system-of-record from presentation.
- Prefer determinism over cleverness.
- Keep infrastructure simple and observable.

The goal is not speed of output.
The goal is understanding system behaviour.

---

## 4. Constraints

The project intentionally avoids:

- Overengineering
- Premature scaling decisions
- Unnecessary service separation
- UI complexity
- Feature creep

This is a backend-first data product.

---

## 5. Professional Discipline

All major decisions are:
- Documented
- Version-controlled
- Explicitly scoped

The repo reflects a production mindset, even while the project is experimental.
